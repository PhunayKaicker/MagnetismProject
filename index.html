            Magnetoreception (also magnetoception) is a sense which allows an organism to detect a magnetic field to perceive direction, altitude or location. This sensory modality is used by a range of animals for orientation and navigation, and as a method for animals to develop regional maps.<br><br>So animals that use the magnetic field to orient themselves do so by detecting these differences in field strength and flow. They then use that information to figure out where they are and where to go.<br><br>Scientists have previously discovered that birds, bats, turtles and salmon (among other fish) are affected by “animal magnetism”. Lobsters have been shown to exhibit magnetic sensitivity, relying upon the earth's magnetic lines to navigate.<br><br>There are a couple of ways in which people believe animals can detect the magnetic field, one of them relies on tiny little intercellular functions inside certain cells of organisms and this is certainly the case for some bacteria and people have identified particles in bees and in other animals. The second way that people believe animals can detect the magnetic field is with some specialised photoreceptors in their eyes, and this applies to many birds and other species. The idea here is that perhaps a photoreceptor cell in the retina of a bird may be able to see the magnetic field just like we can see colour, and from that inform the animal which way they need to go. And so I think that in the case of the wolf and other mammals that people looked at that is the idea that right now they have it. But this is one of the things right we can do experiments that inform us that an organism can orient to magnetic fields but it is a very different thing to find out where the cells that detect the magnetic field or how these animals are detecting, that is what makes it really difficult. And that is one of the things that the little worm we look with comes in really handy because it only has one thousand cells all together so it makes it a lot easier to count.
